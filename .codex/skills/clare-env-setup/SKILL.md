# CLARE Skill: clare-env-setup

description: Detect project file types, recommend tools and VS Code extensions, and optionally generate Dockerfile.clare for reproducible verification runs.

---

This skill provides an `env-scan` helper that inspects a repository, reports which languages and common config files are present, extracts tooling requirements from `clare/verify-ci.sh` and `clare/verify-local.sh`, recommends VS Code extensions, and identifies likely deployment/build/test surfaces that still need CLARE coverage.

Purpose
- Help contributors quickly configure their environment for CLARE verification.
- Provide a small `Dockerfile.clare` to run verification in an isolated container.

Usage

Installing this skill also installs the scanner into your project at
`clare/scripts/clare-env-scan.sh`. Run it from the project root:

- Run the scanner (human-readable report):

  bash clare/scripts/clare-env-scan.sh --report

- Machine-readable JSON output:

  bash clare/scripts/clare-env-scan.sh --json > /tmp/clare-scan.json

- Attempt to update `.vscode/extensions.json` in the repository (use with care):

  bash clare/scripts/clare-env-scan.sh --apply-extensions --vscode-dir .vscode

Notes
- The scanner is intentionally conservative and will only auto-apply VS Code recommendations when explicitly requested.
- The CLARE source repo also ships a `Dockerfile.clare` (under `install/`): a suggested, minimal image to run `./clare/verify-ci.sh --fast` without polluting the host. Copy it into your project and edit it to add or remove language runtimes as needed.

Dockerfile details
- The CLARE source repo's `install/Dockerfile.clare` installs the Go toolchain from the official tarball by default (build-arg `GO_VERSION=1.22.9`). This enables language checks that require `go` and binaries installed via `go install` (for example `shfmt`) to be available inside the container. To override the Go version or skip installation, use `--build-arg GO_VERSION=...` or an empty value to skip.

Installer usage
- The installer supports non-interactive skill installation with the `--install-skill` flag. You can pass a quoted list of numeric indices (as shown during the setup prompt) or `all`. Example:

```bash
./scripts/clare-installer.sh --target /path/to/project --install-skill "1"
./scripts/clare-installer.sh --target /path/to/project --install-skill "all"
```

Outputs
- Plain text report (default `--report`).
- JSON (`--json`) with `fileCounts`, `configsFound`, `verifyTools`, `recommendedExtensions`, `detectedSurfaces`, `verifiedSurfaces`, `coverageGaps`, and `agentPrompts` sections.

See `install/clare/README.md` for additional details and examples.
